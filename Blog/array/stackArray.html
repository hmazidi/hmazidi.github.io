		<p> In this article, we explore the idea of stack by solving two related questions. The idea
            of stack is to allow temporary information be stored and used in a later time by pushing
            and poping operations.

	<p class="problemStatement"> <b> Given a list of daily temperatures \(T\), 
        return a list such that, for each day in the input, tells you how many 
        days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature.
         If there is no future day for which this is possible, put \(0\) instead 
         (<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures">credit </a>).
		</b> </p>
	 
		  <p> Our first clue is that if bunch of consecutive temperatures are decreasing, as soon as 
              we see a positive change in the temperature we need to trigger some housekeeping! 
              Particularly, we know that all the days with lower temperature 
              than the current day we can exactly compute the number of days we need to wait. Further, if some of the earlier
              days have even higher temperature we need to keep the "hot" days in order. This means that 
              when we pruned the days with lower temperature, we put the current day in the correct position 
              with respect to hot days.</p>

              <p>
                  Stack is useful here since we can push the days into it and when we see a 
                  positive change we pop out the days with lower temperature and push the current day
				  into it. This ensures that we keep the correct order w.r.t. hot days! Note that
				  a sub-optimal way to solve this problem is to check for each day the condition of
				  the positive change. This approach gives \(O(N^2)\) complexity.
