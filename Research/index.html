				Overview
			</h3>

			<p style="color: white;">
				Zooming at nanoscale with increasing resolution, specificity, and sensitivity is the new frontier in nanoscale imaging. A
				chief role is played by single emitters, such as fluorescent molecules, that report properties of their nano-neighborhood
				through the imaging system, one at a time. Such controllable, optical sensors enable super-resolution imaging. Capturing
				high-resolution images comes with several challenges of which
				<em>algorithms</em> for inferring molecular parameters, amongst others, stand out. As a member of the Lew Lab and the Center
				for Sensor Signal and Information Processing, I collaborate with optical designers and chemists to provide algorithmic
				solutions for challenging problems.

			<h4>
				Background
			</h4>

			<p>
				One of the powerful feature of Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) is providing quantitative information about
				the structure of the target sample. The accuracy of this quantification hinges on the precision as well as accuracy of
				the point localizations. From the beginning, the overlap of emitters' images was recognized as a significant algorithmic
				challenge. An algorithm that can handle high-emitter density, thus image overlap, can not only reduce the acquisition
				time but also can increase the confidence of measurements. Many algorithms have been developed to analyze high-density
				images that otherwise cause significant errors in localizations.</p>

			<h4>
				Contribution
			</h4>
			<p>
				In this research, we revisited the quantitative analyses of these algorithms with a different perspective in mind. In contrast
				to previous studies, we quantified the structure of errors in resolving bio-inspired structures. These analyses revealed
				that conventional metrics fail to characterize the
				<i>bias</i>, or the accuracy, of the reconstructed structures. To minimize these biases, we built a RObust Statistical Estimation
				algorithm, RoSE, which attempts to answer following questions:
				<br> </p>

			<p id="reserachQuestionBox">
				How can we estimate the likelihood that a fluorescent molecule is emitting light from each pixel within an object domain?
				And how can we estimate the likelihood that a molecule within a pixel belongs to an unknown target structure? And how
				can we estimate the likelihood that a molecule within a pixel belongs to an unknown target structure?
			</p>

			<p>
				RoSE works for arbitrary 3D point spread functions (PSFs) and biological structures. It calculates the likelihood that each
				image pixel contains a molecule, and not background light, by leveraging spatial sparsity. Further, by analyzing blinking
				statistics, it can also calculate the confidence of each pixel in truly representing the target structure. RoSE thereby
				minimizes false localizations that cause bias and artifacts in super-resolution microscopy.
