<h1>
 Distance between two documents using Bag-of-Words representation
</h1>
	  <article>
		  During my little experiments, I realized that KNN classification on top of the Bag-of-Words 
		  representation exhibits different performances using two intimately related distances in \(R^{N}\): Cosine similarity   and 
		  Euclidien distance. 
		  
		  In breif, Coseine similarity normalizes the Euclidien distance between \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\)
		  by their magnitudes. Simply consider two vectors \(\mathbf{u}=[1,\ 0,\ 0]\) and \(\mathbf{v}=[101,\ 0,\ 0]\). Then cosine_similarity(\(\mathbf{u}
		  , \mathbf{v})= 1\), and  euclidien_distance(\(\mathbf{u}
		  , \mathbf{v})= 100\)!
		  
		  For comparing two  documents that are  represented by their word counts from a dictinory, that is the Bag-of-Words 
		  representation, the choice of distance metric can have a dramatic effect.
