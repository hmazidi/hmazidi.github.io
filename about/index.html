Given an array \(A\) of \(n\) positive integers and a positive integer \(s\), find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum \(â‰¥ s\). If there isn't one, return \(0\) instead.

<p>As a problem solver we need to pay attention to the conditions of the problem in order to adjust to it. In this problem, the positiveness
of the array elements defines a useful structure on this array. In particular, this positive structure implies the following:
  
  <p> Let \(k\in [0,n-1)\). Then if \(\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_{i} > s\), it follows that \(\forall j>k, \sum_{i=0}^{j} a_{i} > s\).
