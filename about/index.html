Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

As a problem solver we need to pay attention to the conditions of the problem in order to adjust to it. In this problem, the positiveness
of the array elements defines a useful structure on this array. This structure can be exploited for certain task.
