Given an array of n positive integers and a positive integer s, find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum â‰¥ s. If there isn't one, return 0 instead.

<p>As a problem solver we need to pay attention to the conditions of the problem in order to adjust to it. In this problem, the positiveness
of the array elements defines a useful structure on this array. In particular, this positive structure implies the following:
  
  <p> Let $i\in 6$
