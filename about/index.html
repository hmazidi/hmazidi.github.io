<p> <b> Given an array \(A\) of \(n\) positive integers and a positive integer \(s\), find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum \(â‰¥ s\). If there isn't one, return \(0\) instead.
	</b> </p>
<p>As a problem solver we need to pay attention to the conditions of the problem in order to adjust to it. In this problem, the positiveness
of the array elements defines a useful structure on this array. In particular, this positive structure implies the following:</p>
  
  <p> Let \(k\in [0,n-1)\). Then if \(\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_{i} \geq s\), it follows that \(\forall j>k, \sum_{i=0}^{j} a_{i} \geq s\).</p>
    <p> Simply put, if we encounter a contiguous subarray with sum\(\geq s\) we can safely ignore the first element of the current subarray 
      as it contains no additional information.</p>
      <p> Another observation is that when we have computed the sum of a subarray it is really easy to compute the next subarray as it requires 
        adding one element. Thus we may use these structures defined by the conditions of the problem, i.e., positivity of elements and having contiguous array.

	  <p> Next, we look into a similar problem where there is no positive structure in the array.</p>
	  
	  <p>
		 <b> Given an array \(A\), nums, and a target value \(k\), find the maximum length of a subarray that sums to \(k\).
			 If there isn't one, return \(0\) instead.</b>
	  </p>
		  <p> The idea here is that as we increment cursum there is alwasy a possibility of \(\sum_{i=\text{left}}^{\text{right}} a[i]=k\) for some
		  index \(\text{left}\). It seems that we need to compute bunch of summations every time we increment the right index. However,
			  
			  all we need is to store these sums somewhere and whenever we need them we can retreive them fast. In fact, a <em>hashmap</em> is 
			  presicely based on this idea. The idea is shown below </p>

                        </p>
				
	  <p>Therefore all we need to compute is cursum and storing it in a hashmap <em>AllSums</em> along with its index. Note that it is possible to find subarrays with the same sum. In this case we only need to
	       store the one with minimum left index!
