Given an array \(A\) of \(n\) positive integers and a positive integer \(s\), find the minimal length of a contiguous subarray of which the sum \(â‰¥ s\). If there isn't one, return \(0\) instead.

<p>As a problem solver we need to pay attention to the conditions of the problem in order to adjust to it. In this problem, the positiveness
of the array elements defines a useful structure on this array. In particular, this positive structure implies the following:</p>
  
  <p> Let \(k\in [0,n-1)\). Then if \(\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_{i} \geq s\), it follows that \(\forall j>k, \sum_{i=0}^{j} a_{i} \geq s\).</p>
    <p> Simply put, if we encounter a contiguous subarray with sum\(\geq s\) we can safely ignore the first element of the current subarray 
      as it contains no additional information.</p>
      <p> Another observation is that when we have computed the sum of a subarray it is really easy to compute the next subaaray as it requires 
        adding one element. Thus we may use these structures defined by the conditions of the problem, i.e., positivity of elements and having contigous array.
     
      We can therefore exploit this observation to reduce the  computation:</p>
<p> 1- set \(i=0, j=1,\text{minlength}=0, \text{cursum}=0\);<br/>
    2- compute the index \(k\) for which \(sum_{i=0}^{k} a_{i} \geq s)\
